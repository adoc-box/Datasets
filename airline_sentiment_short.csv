681455380,negative,Southwest,@SouthwestAir answered. My options are a refund or a resched for Monday (I'd miss work). So I'm paying hundreds for a @USAirways flight tmw.
681457922,negative,Delta,@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
681452382,negative,United,@united delayed another hour
